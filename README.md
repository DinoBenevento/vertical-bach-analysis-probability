# **Vertical Bach Analysis Probability**
This project born on the idea to calculate the probability of all possible note repetitions after each single chord in the 4-voice Bach cholares.

Are scanned all Bach 4-voice chorales with the used of the library **music21** and for each chorale is wrote a pickle where is specified the vertical chord, the numbers of occurences of the chord, it's occurances and the report for each notes played after the chord for every voice.

## Result
Into the folder **saveProb** there are 4 txt files where are specified for each chord into 4 voice chorales, the probability to find the indivcated note.

Infact the files are formatted:

[Chord]; [Nota]; [Probability to find the note after the chord]
